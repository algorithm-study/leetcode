* [Majority Element] (https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/) - `Easy`

Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊ n/2 ⌋ times. You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

* [Find Peak Element] (https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/) - `Medium`

A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors. Given an input array where num[i] ≠ num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index. The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any one of the peaks is fine. You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -∞. For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

* [Pow(x, n)] (https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/) - `Medium`

Implement pow(x, n)

* [Sqrt(x)] (https://oj.leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/) - `Medium`

Implement int sqrt(int x). Compute and return the square root of x.
